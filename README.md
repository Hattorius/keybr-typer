# Keybr typer
## Why?
Classmate started automizing this. Had to do it too. Record: 147.8 WPM (that got recorded by heybr.com as well)

## How it work?
1. Starts browser
2. Reads all words
3. Writes words
4. Keeps on doing this but with lower timeout between the keys every game
5. After ab 7-10 minutes you'll get a very high score

## Why timeout lower and lower and lower?
Honestly, though that it might somehow eventually bypass the limit. But I guess there's a limit of 150 WPM on Keybr

## Requirements
 - Selenium
 - Python (I run Python 3.10.5)
